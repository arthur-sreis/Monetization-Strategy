I. Company Information
First, please read the descriptions of a company's product, acquisition channels, original pricing scheme, and modified pricing scheme below.

Product Description
The product offered by the company is online learning in the domains of recreational and professional development. It is targeted at individuals, groups of individuals, and small companies looking to provide employees with professional and recreational development.

Learners can access a library of 1,000 courses. Each time they take a course counts as a “class”, including repeat attempts.
They can purchase as many learner licenses as they want.
Solutions and grading for the project are offered only in the Pro tier and above.
Acquisition channels
Paid search
Paid referral: Learners can refer their friends. If they sign up for a paid plan, then both learners are paid a referral bonus (see below for payout details).
Team Project Invitation: All projects are group projects for which the learners have to team up with another paid user by inviting them. If the teammate is already a user then they can just add them to their team.
Original Pricing Scheme
Each referral by an existing learner that results in a completed signup of a paid user produces a bonus of $50 each for both the referrer and the referred.
Learners can sign up for the free plan without providing a credit card.
Learners see an upsell prompt to upgrade to higher tiers.
Only learners in the premium tier can access a forum of other users to ask questions, discuss issues, and find project teammates.

Modified Pricing Scheme
A round of analysis on the original pricing scheme produced the following insights:

Forums produce a lot of unpaid referrals by way of team project invitations. This helps in acquisition without raising costs.
There is a lot of appetite for more classes, exercise solutions and project grading.
There isn’t much value offered in the premium tier to justify the steep increase in price. Few users upgrade and those that do, eventually end up downgrading or canceling.
Summary of key changes to act upon the insights (highlighted below in yellow):

Learners now have an option to increase the number of classes they can take per month. They have to pay on a recurring basis.
Learners see an upsell prompt to upgrade to higher tiers as well as to purchase overage classes per month.
Forums are now accessible to users in all tiers.
Free plan
The free plan now offers only one class rather than one per month.
Learners have to sign up with a credit card. It is not charged until they upgrade to a paid plan or purchase a recurring overage.
The premium plan now offers a completion certificate from an accredited institution and team reports for the consumption of a company wide administrator. It charges 58% more than before.
The referral bonus stays the same.

II. Project Starter Resources
Input Dataset
Please download the provided input dataset in the spreadsheet doc in the Resources tab in the left sidebar of the classroom here, or you may make a copy of it as a Google Sheet here.

Notes on input dataset spreadsheet:
Only absolute values are provided for each month.
Percent values remain the same month over month and are therefore mentioned only in the first column.
Left indented values sum up to the row above it.
Rows highlighted in yellow are ‘bootstrap rows’. They are only populated for the month of Dec 2018. They are needed to calculate some of the rows for Jan 2019; the first month of the model. For the remaining months, you need to calculate the actual values for the bootstrap rows.
Unless otherwise stated, all percentages are calculated off of the previous level and not the top level.
For any extra steps in a funnel that you would like to add, feel free to make assumptions about numbers.
III. Project Instructions
Documents to use for your work below:
For models, use only spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheet, or Numbers). Using one spreadsheet with multiple tabs is fine, or create multiple spreadsheets. Create helpful names for your documents and/or tabs.
For written work (steps 4, 7, 9), use a word/text-editing tool, such as MS Word, Google Docs, or Sublime, to create a text or word document.
Please combine all of the documents above that you have worked on into one zip file for submission.
Part I
Build the base monetization models necessary to evaluate the 2019 performance of the business in the following areas:

Lead acquisition efficiency
Paid customer conversion
Revenue generation
Profitability
The models should cover the following key stages in the customer journey:

Sign-up
Convert to paid customer
Upgrade plan
Downgrade plan
Cancel account
Re-subscribe
Use the following information for this part:

'Original Pricing Scheme' (see above)
"Original Pricing - Inputs" tab in the input dataset
Part II
Analyze the base models and come up with a list of product improvements that can potentially improve the size of the customer base and revenue. You should share at least three improvements for each of the six stages of the customer journey:

Sign-up
Convert to paid customer
Upgrade plan
Downgrade plan
Cancel account
Re-subscribe
Estimate the quantified contribution of each improvement to the relevant KPI impacted by that improvement (e.g conversion rate, exposure %). The KPI should tie back to some line item in the model. It is fine to make assumptions about contributions.

Pick one improvement from each of the six stages, plug the corresponding estimate of impact into the model and forecast the change in customer base and revenue. A single combined forecast for all changes is sufficient.

Part III
Propose a change to the Original Pricing Scheme, either in the number of tiers, or the feature organization per tier, or the pricing metric, or the personas, or some other aspect discussed in the course. Then describe how this change will help the monetization goals.

Now take a look at the ‘Modified Pricing Scheme’ above and modify the original base monetization models to accommodate the new pricing scheme. The corresponding input numbers for this are in the second tab of the input dataset spreadsheet, titled “Modified Pricing - Inputs”.

Analyze the impacts of the new Modified Pricing Scheme presented here, and list at least three pros and three cons.
